This is a simple program to grab photos from National Georgaphic Photo Of The Day page and save 'em to the working folder. 
Some time ago they had a beautiful high-res content there, so I used this crawler to grab pictures for wallpapers, but now they're mostly small images, which is sad. Probably I just don't have an idea how to get URLs for high-res, but this is at least unavailable for a regular visitor as well.
Thus current utility is useless =(
Requires Requests lib.
